**STORING LAND RECORDS USING BLOCKCHAIN**
Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the traditional land records management system by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability of land records, reducing fraud and enhancing trust in land transactions.

Key Features
Blockchain Integration: Utilizes a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) for storing land records securely.
Smart Contracts: Implements smart contracts to automate and validate land transactions.
Immutable Ledger: Provides an unalterable ledger of land ownership and transactions.
User Authentication: Ensures secure access to land records through user authentication mechanisms.
Permissioned Access: Differentiates access levels for stakeholders (e.g., government authorities, landowners).
History Tracking: Maintains a transparent history of land transactions for audit purposes.
Tech Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain for decentralized ledger and smart contracts.
Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum) or other compatible languages.
Frontend: React JS
Backend (Optional): NODE JS
Decentralized Storage: POLYGON NETWORK
